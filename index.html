        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a first-generation student at UC Riverside, majoring in Psychology. Being the oldest and having no guidance from anyone made it difficult for me. Not having anyone to look up to in an academic setting, made it challenging for me to manage my time, interact with others, and do the best that I could do in school. Having to figure out everything on my own led to me struggling with anxiety and learning how to manage it. I did so through poetry. Ever since I was younger Iâ€™ve always wanted to work in the healthcare field. I have had experience working in the healthcare field. Although I enjoy helping others with their physical health. I love being present for people. Assisting others with their mental health, through poetry. Inspiring others to get into poetry as a way to express themselves. Also even treating poetry and writing it as a sort of therapeutic exercise and feel free to share it with others. This blog allows people to find comfort in writing and possibly even a passion for it. 
<br><br>

        Throughout my high school years, I have been part of my local health clinic. Assisting patients with their health needs. As I continued to work with patients, I realized that not only was their physical health taking a toll on them but also their mental health due to them trying to focus on their physical health. My aspiration for psychology and wanting to discover more about the human mind developed while working with patients at this same clinic. As I struggle with my own mental health, Iâ€™ve learned to see it as one of my strengths in my life. Poetry being a way to express myself, has allowed me to talk about mental health in a less stigmatized way and talk more openly about it. Viewing mental health on the same level of importance as our physical health, both the mind and body work together, if our mind is not doing well neither will our body, vice versa. <br><br>

        Having this experience has inspired me to write poetry. Poetry allows one to focus on oneâ€™s creativity, patience, and memory and helps improve oneâ€™s self-awareness. It serves as an overall distraction from the stress that one is surrounded by in day to day life. Creating this poetry blog will hopefully allow people to get into poetry, express themselves, and find connectivity with some poetry pieces written by myself and others. Overall, my goal and passion in life is to help others, by assisting them with their mental health and when in situations of crisis. As I continued to study psychology, I realized that there are different ways to come into the field. Either as a social worker, counselor, or therapist. Having these options allows me to help others, especially those in the same age range as myself and being first generation students in college. My own experience has allowed me to find a career path that I am passionate about and assisting others to do so as well.
